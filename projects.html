Users may also be prompted to enter credit card information or bank account details as well as other sensitive data. Once this information is collected, attackers may use it to access accounts, steal data and identities, and download malware onto the user’s computer. To avoid this, the only solution is to identify if there is a threat of phishing or not based on certain factors. This is really important from the security point of view.

Stations are usually ranked into top, middle, and low level, and further disaggregated into terminal or intermediate ones. The operational program determines the arrangement, use and levels of station platforms and tracks. Timetables are either periodic or non-periodic. Analytical and simulation methods are used to estimate track capacity consumption, calculate train running times, and simulate train operations. Optimization methods are increasingly applied for performance assessment of network timetables and assignment of platform tracks.

                  The Fjelstul world cup database contains data about the FIFA world cup taken from Wikipedia mainly and compiled in a <a href = "https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup">single dataset</a>. It contains world cup details from 1930-2018.
                  The database has 5 groups of datasets.
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>The first contains details like tournament, confedereations, teams, players, managers, refrees, stadiums, matches and awards</li>
                    <li>The second contains tournament based information like qualified teans, manager appointments, squads and refree appointments</li>
                    <li>The third has match based information like team appearances, manager appearances, refree appearances and squads</li>
                    <li>The fourth contains in-match details like goals, penalty kicks, bookings and substituions</li>
                    <li>The fifth covers tournament level attributes such as host nation, stages, groups, standings and award winners</li>

                  The emergence of large-scale online digital systems that harvest and mediate access to collective human behavior and knowledge will have an unprecedented impact on social science research. However, many researchers lack the expertise and computational resources necessary to transform the raw data resulting from these systems into meaningful metrics that can be employed in scientific modeling and analysis.

                  When expertise and computational resources are coincident for individual researchers or research groups, the resulting fruits of their labor are often siloed and seldom shared to the widespread scientific community. In this project, we aim to develop a set of tools that will provide researchers with real-time access to meaningful, rich and context-inclusive metrics on emerging events throughout the world. To accomplish this, we will provide real-time analysis of raw data on the content, context, production and consumption of information on Wikipedia..
