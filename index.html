            <p class = "capstonedescription">The capstone project has become an integral part of the university degree curriculum. 
              It can take many various forms, but its purpose remains the same. 
              The capstone project is a unique opportunity to carry out independent group research 
              in order to devise an innovative solution for a real-world problem. 
              While a project of this scope and scale can be challenging, it can also be very rewarding.
              The capstone project is usually the final assignment and plays a vital role 
              in preparing students for the world of work thanks to its practical applications 
              and ability to help hone students' professional knowledge and skills.
              The capstone project is designed to consolidate final-year students' 
              learning with valuable hands-on experience to help develop them into well-prepared 
              and well-rounded graduates.
            </p>
            <p class = "capstonedescription">It prepares you for the working world. 
              It helps build your CV and help you stand out as a candidate.
              Students work together in small groups to come up with innovative solutions 
              for real-life problems, all while gaining valuable insights into the demands 
              and responsibilities of the working world. 
              This gives students a chance to bring their leadership 
              and management skills alive and understand the consequences of their decisions 
              in a 'safe space'.
              It offers valuable practical experience - something many graduates do not have
              It hones on specific skills that are highly valued by employers.
              The capstone project encompasses a real-life working culture which aims to instil a set of specific skills that 
              are both highly valued by employers and will ultimately serve students well into their careers.
